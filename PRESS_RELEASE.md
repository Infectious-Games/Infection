##Summary
```
Disease is running rampant and bioterrorists are among us, working to prevent the administration of a cure. Should we fail 
to contain more than three outbreaks, the world will fall into chaos. Your job as a scientist on our task force is to develop
and administer the cure to an affected city, while also trying to discover whom among your team is a saboteur. Luckily, you
have access to advanced technology to aid you in your investigation, including facial recognition based security clearance, 
advanced lie detecting software, and Pal 3000 (an advanced AI whose programmed purpose is to protect humanity).
