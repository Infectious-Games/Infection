```
Infection has gone viral, and the fun is contagious
```

## Description
```
Disease is running rampant and bioterrorists are among us, working to prevent the administration of a cure. Should we fail 
to contain more than three outbreaks, the world will fall into chaos. Your job as a scientist on our task force is to develop
and administer the cure to an affected city, while also trying to discover whom among your team is a saboteur. Luckily, you
have access to advanced technology to aid you in your investigation, including facial recognition based security clearance, 
advanced lie detecting software, and Pal 3000 (an advanced AI whose programmed purpose is to protect humanity).
```
## Market
``` 
Inspired by the growing trend in bluffing-based, social games, Infection is the game of the future. Via the app, players are no longer location dependent and can play anywhere, at anytime. Turn an evening at home or out at a bar, into a raucous game of deduction and intrigue.

"As soon as the game started, we were all yelling at each other and having a great time" -Paul Marinaro

"I love that playing Infection is aways an option. I don't have to bother with lugging around a boardgame on the off chance
my friends and I decide to play something!" -Athena Turek
